# Chips

Chips are small, interactive elements that represent a piece of information.
They are typically used to display tags, categories, selections, or filters in a concise and
visually appealing manner. Chips can be used individually or grouped together to form sets.


## Filter Chips

Filter chips are designed to provide a visual representation of selected filters and enable
users to easily add or remove filters based on their preferences.

Alternatively, filter chips can be configured to only allow a single option to be selected
from a list of choices, often used for filtering or categorizing content.
