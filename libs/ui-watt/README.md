# ui-watt

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running the project

Run `yarn run docs:json` before using NX console to execute running the project, or always use `yarn run designsystem:start` if not using NX.
This is because the project needs the JSON Docs generated before being able to run it.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test ui-watt` to execute the unit tests.
