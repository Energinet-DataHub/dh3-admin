## Stack

The `vater-stack` layout component is a simple element designed to create stack-based layouts
with ease. It allows you to arrange child elements vertically (in a column) or horizontally
(in a row) within a container. If the dimensions of the child elements surpass the container's
width (or height, depending on the stacking direction), they will shrink when possible or otherwise
overflow to fit the available space. They will never expand beyond their original dimensions.

  <watt-button>Ok</watt-button>
  <watt-button>Close</watt-button>
</vater-stack>
  `}
/>

## Flex
Next layout component is `vater-flex`, meant to simplify the creation of flexible layouts.
Like the `vater-stack` component, it provides the ability to arrange child elements vertically
(column) or horizontally (row). What makes `vater-flex` distinct is its ability to stretch
child elements along the flex direction. Additionally, the component offers a `scrollable` input,
allowing the container to shrink beyond the minimum height while showing a scrollbar.
