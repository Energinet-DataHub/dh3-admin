    <h2 #what_is_energy_origin>What is Energy Origin?</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of the Energy Origin platform is to create transparency on the
      origin of energy for all energy consumers and to facilitate a market for
      for green energy. Currently, we are working on data related to electricity
      consumption. Upon login, you will soon be able to access your hourly
      electricity declaration and corresponding emissions for 2021
    </p>

    <h2 #who_can_access_the_platform>Who can access the platform?</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the platform only offers company login via NemID. Later on, it
      will be possible for private individuals to login via NemID / MitID
    </p>

    <h2 #where_does_the_data_come_from>Where does te data come from?</h2>
    <p>
      All data related to metering points, consumption and production is served
      by the Energinet DataHub. Data related to the origin of energy and
      corresponding emissions stem from Energi Data Service
    </p>
