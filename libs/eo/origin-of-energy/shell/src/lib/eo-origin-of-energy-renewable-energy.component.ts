      Renewable energy is a general term for bio-energy, onshore and offshore
      wind power, solar energy, geothermal energy as well as other technologies
      that differ from coal and other fossil fuels by being CO2 neutral. The use
      of sustainable energy sources contributes to the reduction of our
      greenhouse gas emissions and making Denmark independent of fossil energy.
